# AWS Greengrass Setup for Zymbit Devices

This repository has the scripts for setting up AWS Greengrass to use the keys in Zymbit's HSM to generate certificates for Greengrass devices. These scripts were adopted from [here](https://github.com/aws-iot-builder-tools/aws-greengrass-provisioner/tree/421d8ea4a73d8de160307f4ca0563f9d90c5ff26).
